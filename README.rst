Python run_lambda
=================

``run_lambda`` is a Python package providing functionality for running Python
`AWS Lambda <https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/>`_ functions locally. It offers a
Python module for automated testing of Lambda functions, as well as a
command-line interface for ad-hoc local invocations.

To date, ``run_lambda`` has only been tested on Linux systems. If you choose to
use it on other platforms, please be wary of the memory usage statistics it
generates.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install is via ``pip``::

    $ pip install run_lambda

You can also download the source from
